  - **Why** solve this problem?
    - **significance**: Existing offloading strategies cannot handle the procedure for mobility-aware computation-intensive services, and also do not take cross-edge collaboration into account.
  - **How** to solve this problem?
    - **formulation**: 
      - These 4 factors are taken into account:
        - (1) transmission delay
        - (2) execution delay
        - (3) collaboration/coo rdination cost
        - (4) battery energy level
      - **several constraints**:
        - (1) exec deadline >= maximum delay(trans + exec) + local exec delay + collaboration cost = TIME COST
        - (2) battery level >= local exec battery cost + sum of trans battery cost
      - **objective**(a non-convex optimization problem):
        - Find the minimum expectation of COST, where COST is TIME COST + DROPPING PENALTY.
    - **method**:
      - Cross-edge Computation Offloading algorithm(CCO)
      - Sampling-and-classification based edge site-selection algorithm(SES).
  - **Why** use this method?
    - **comments**:
      - The author decomposed the problem into two sub-problem: (1) edge site selection (2) evaluate optimized cost of the selection.
        - (1) SES. Sample-and-classification (SAC) based algo was proposed with the subroutine being restricted as *a binary classification algorithms*. [Common binary classification algorithms](https://towardsdatascience.com/top-10-binary-classification-algorithms-a-beginners-guide-feeacbd7a3e2)
        - (2) Lyapunov function was introduced to formulate the battery level of devices, which is appropriate for devices that are able to harvest energy. Consequently, asymptotic optimal result of a specific selection can be calculated, which makes selections sampled by SAC algorithm evaluable, enabling SES works properly.
    - **inspiration**:
         - (1) Based on Lyapunov optimization, **priori knowledge on mobility** is not necessary to know.
         - (2) By introducing SAC, a high-dimensional non-differentiable problem is reduced to **a binary classification problem**.
         - (3) H. Zhao gave a good introduction of Lyapunov optimization in Chinese which helps me a lot in understanding it. [Lyapunov Optimization Introduction](http://hliangzhao.me/math/Lyapunov_optimization.pdf)

         - How other simple dynamic-programming based algorithms work on this problem?
         - Is there any other derivatie-dree optimization algorithm solves the selection problem better?

      - By careful observation, some concise/novel optimal method could be found to solve some specific problems rather than using traditional methods.
      - Actually, optimal sub-problems are obvious to find in this scenario of topological edge network, but formulation and modeling methods are worth learning.
